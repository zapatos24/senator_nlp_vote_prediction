The summary of that version is repeated here.) Highlights: This bill provides continuing FY2016 appropriations to federal agencies until December 11, 2015, or the enactment of specified appropriations legislation. It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when FY2016 begins on October 1, 2015, because none of the twelve FY2016 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have been enacted.  The bill funds most projects and activities at the FY2015 levels, with the inclusion of an across-the-board reduction of less than 1% to most programs. The bill also includes a number of exceptions which provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations to various programs.  The bill extends several programs and laws that are scheduled to expire at the end of FY2015, including the E-Verify program and the moratorium imposed by the Internet Tax Freedom Act. (Unless otherwise indicated, all extensions referenced in this summary are for the duration of the CR.)  The bill also provides $700 million in emergency appropriations for Forest Service wildland fire suppression activities. Emergency funds are exempt from limits on discretionary spending.  The bill requires the Transportation Security Administration to take a number of actions to ensure that Office of Inspection employees that are classified and paid as criminal investigators meet all of the legal and regulatory requirements for criminal investigator positions.  Full Summary:  TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015 or the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016  (Sec. 4) Requires the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) to: (1) analyze the data and methods used by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to classify Office of Inspection (OOI) employees as criminal investigators; and (2) report relevant findings, including whether the data and methods are adequate and valid.  Prohibits the TSA from hiring new OOI employees if the OIG finds that the data and methods are inadequate or invalid until: (1) the TSA certifies to Congress that only OOI employees who meet the minimum legal requirements are classified as criminal investigators and are receiving premium pay and other benefits associated with the classification, and (2) the OIG finds that the TSA's certification utilized adequate and valid data and methods.  (Sec. 5) Requires the TSA to: (1) certify to Congress that only OOI employees who meet the minimum legal requirements are classified as criminal investigators and are receiving premium pay and other benefits associated with the classification, (2) reclassify OOI criminal investigator employees who do not, or are not expected to, spend an average of at least 50% of their time performing criminal investigative duties, and (3) report to Congress on the long-term cost savings from reclassified positions.  (Sec. 6) Requires the TSA to report to Congress on the OOI's review of instances in which Federal Air Marshal Service officials obtained discounted or free firearms for personal use.  (Sec. 7) Requires the OIG to submit to Congress a report: (1) reviewing the employee requirements, responsibilities, and benefits of criminal investigators in the OOI with criminal investigators employed at agencies adhering to the Office of Personnel Management employee classification system; and (2) identifying any inconsistencies and costs implications for differences between the varying employee requirements, responsibilities, and benefits.  (Sec. 8) Requires the OIG to submit to Congress a study reviewing: (1) the Federal Air Marshal Service's existing personnel policies and procedures for identifying misuse of government resources; and (2) the administration of the Federal Air Marshal Service's existing code of conduct or integrity policies with respect to instances of misconduct.

Applies the point of order to legislation that would cause a net increase in on-budget deficits in excess of $5 billion in any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution. (The existing Senate long-term deficit point of order applies to deficits rather than on-budget deficits.)  Exempts Senate legislation for which the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has made adjustments to the allocations, levels, and limits in this resolution, pursuant to the deficit-neutral reserve fund included in Section 4303(1) for legislation relating to the full repeal of the Affordable Care Act.  Establishes a point of order in the House against legislation with a net effect of increasing direct spending by more than $5 billion in any of the four consecutive ten-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.

(Sec. 3104) Establishes a point of order against full-year FY2016 appropriations legislation that includes changes in mandatory programs that affect the Crime Victims Fund and exceed $10.8 billion for FY2016.

(Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages and charge the fees to guarantee the payment of principal and interest. This section prevents the fee increases from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.)  (Sec. 3111) Requires CBO to include in deficit projections a one-page statement that: (1) summarizes and categorizes total outlays, receipts, surpluses, and deficits on a unified basis; and (2) includes subtotals for outlays for mandatory and discretionary programs; outlays, payroll tax revenue, and offsetting receipts for Social Security and for Medicare; the surplus or deficit of revenues over outlays for Social Security and Medicare; and revenues.  (Sec. 3112) Directs CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to provide estimates of the macroeconomic effects of major legislation. (These estimates are frequently referred to as dynamic scoring and include estimates of the budgetary effects from changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation. In the Senate, the estimates would be provided for informational purposes only.)  Subtitle B--Budget Enforcement in the Senate  (Sec. 3201) Extends procedures in the Senate for waivers and appeals of specified budget points of order with a vote of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn (currently 60 votes) through September 30, 2025.

The short-term deficit point of order applies to legislation that would cause a net increase in the deficit in excess of $10 billion in any fiscal year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution unless it is fully offset over the period of all fiscal years provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.)

(Under the resolution, an advanced appropriation is any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2016 that first becomes available after FY2016, or any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2017 that first becomes available after FY2017. The point of order limits advanced appropriations to specified accounts and prohibits total advanced appropriations from exceeding $28.852 billion in new budget authority in each fiscal year).  (Sec. 3203) Increases the vote threshold for waiving points of order against legislation with unfunded intergovernmental mandates from a simple majority to three-fifths of Members duly chosen and sworn (currently 60 votes).  (Sec. 3204) Repeals the Senate point of order against reconciliation legislation that would increase the deficit or reduce a surplus.

(Under this resolution, an advanced appropriation is any new discretionary budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for the fiscal year following FY2016.)  (Sec. 3305) Requires the House of Representatives to assess the implementation of section 3207 of this concurrent resolution through a collaborative assessment with the Senate and CBO of the appropriate scorekeeping methodology for energy savings performance contracts.

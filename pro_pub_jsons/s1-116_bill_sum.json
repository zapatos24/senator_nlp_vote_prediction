Ileana Ros-Lehtinen United States-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2019 The bill reauthorizes through\u00a0FY2028 Foreign Military Financing to Israel. It extends loan guarantees to Israel through FY2023 and authorizes the President to transfer precision-guided munitions to the country.  The bill\u00a0directs the President to report on steps taken to help Israel secure a strategic trade authorization exception.  The bill directs the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to continue working with the Israel Space Agency to pursue peaceful space exploration, and authorizes the Department of State to enter into a memorandum of understanding with Israel to coordinate assistance efforts for developing nations. The President is authorized to enter into a cooperative project agreement with Israel to develop technology to counter unmanned aerial vehicles.  United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Extension Act The bill\u00a0extends through 2022 arrangements that allow certain defense articles to be transferred to Jordan on an expedited basis. The bill\u00a0also directs the President to submit a report to Congress assessing the costs and benefits of establishing a fund to support private investment in Jordan.  Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 The bill\u00a0directs the Department of the Treasury to determine whether the Central Bank of Syria is a primary money-laundering concern and, if so, impose special measures on transactions involving the bank. The bill also imposes sanctions on foreign individuals providing support for the Syrian government, or the military forces or contractors acting on behalf of Syria, Russia, or Iran. The sanctions include blocking of financial and property transactions and barring of entry into the United States. Such sanctions shall not apply to various nongovernmental organizations and activities related to providing humanitarian aid or supporting democratic institutions in Syria.  The President may suspend the sanctions under certain conditions, including if it is in the United States' national security interests. Combating BDS Act of 2019 The bill allows a state or\u00a0local government to\u00a0adopt measures to divest its assets from entities using boycotts, divestments, or sanctions to influence Israel's policies. Such measures shall meet various requirements, including those related to written notice and comment. It also bars lawsuits against investment companies based solely on a company's decision to divest from entities that use boycotts, divestments, or sanctions to influence Israel's policies. The bill expresses the sense of the Senate that, before any significant withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria or Afghanistan, the President should certify that the conditions for the enduring defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS have been met.

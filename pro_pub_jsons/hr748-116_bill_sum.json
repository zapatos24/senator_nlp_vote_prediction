The SBA shall waive (1) any rules related to the personal guarantee on advances and loans under a certain amount, (2) the requirement that an applicant must be in business for the one-year period prior to the disaster (except that no waiver may be made for a business not in operation on January 31, 2020), and (3) the requirement that an applicant be unable to obtain credit elsewhere. (Sec. 1111) This section requires the SBA to provide its resources and services in the 10 most commonly spoken languages, other than English, in the United States.

(Sec. 2104) This section provides appropriations to fund federal-state agreements under which the amount of an individual's weekly unemployment compensation includes an additional $600 in federal pandemic unemployment compensation. Such payments shall apply to weeks of unemployment beginning after the date of the agreement and ending on or before July 31, 2020. Such an agreement shall not apply with respect to a state that reduces the maximum duration or average weekly benefit amount of its regular unemployment compensation as in effect on January 1, 2020.

Subtitle B--Rebates and Other Individual Provisions This subtitle allows individual taxpayers below a certain income level and their dependent children a one-time refundable tax credit and other tax benefits to compensate for financial losses due to COVID-19 (i.e., the coronavirus disease 2019). (Sec. 2201) This section allows individual taxpayers a refundable income tax credit of $1,200 ($2,400 for married couples filing a joint return). A $500 credit is allowed for each qualifying child of the taxpayer. The credit is eliminated for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes exceeding $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns). To be eligible for the credit, taxpayers must include valid identification numbers (e.g., Social Security numbers) on their tax returns. The Department of the Treasury must conduct a public awareness campaign regarding the availability of the credit. (Sec. 2202) This section permits penalty-free coronavirus-related distributions from tax-exempt retirement plans up to $100,000 in a taxable year. A coronavirus-related distribution is defined as any distributions from an eligible retirement plan made on or after January 1, 2020, and before December 31, 2020, to an individual who is (1) diagnosed with the virus SARS-CoV-2, (2) whose spouse or dependent is diagnosed with such virus or disease, or (3) who experienced adverse financial consequences from being quarantined, furloughed, or laid off from work due to such virus or disease.

TITLE III--SUPPORTING AMERICA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE CORONAVIRUS Subtitle A--Health Provisions Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act PART I--ADDRESSING SUPPLY SHORTAGES Subpart A--Medical Product Supplies (Sec. 3101) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to report on the security of the U.S. medical product supply chain. (Sec. 3102) The strategic national stockpile must include personal protective equipment and supplies required for the administration of drugs, vaccines, biological products, medical devices, and diagnostic tests. (Sec. 3103) This section revises targeted liability protections with respect to certain claims arising from the use of a respiratory protective device (i.e., mask) approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Such protections shall apply if HHS declares such a device to be a priority for use during a declared public health emergency. Subpart B--Mitigating Emergency Drug Shortages (Sec. 3111) If notified by a manufacturer of a likely disruption in the supply of a medicine, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must, as appropriate (1) prioritize and expedite an application review to help mitigate or prevent a drug shortage, or (2) prioritize and expedite an inspection or reinspection of an establishment that could help mitigate or prevent a drug shortage. (Sec. 3112) This section expands reporting requirements for manufacturers with respect to drug shortages and requires such manufacturers to develop risk-management plans. The FDA must periodically transmit a report of shortage drugs to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. If an FDA inspection reveals that a drug or product under shortage or interruption may have become contaminated, a report must be sent to relevant FDA personnel with drug-shortage expertise. Subpart C--Preventing Medical Device Shortages (Sec. 3121) The manufacturer of a device critical to public health during a public health emergency shall notify the FDA of an interruption or permanent discontinuance. If the FDA finds the existence of a shortage or likely shortage, it must prioritize and expedite (1) a device application review that could mitigate or prevent a shortage, or (2) an inspection or reinspection of an establishment that could mitigate or prevent a shortage. PART II--ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS Subpart A--Coverage of Testing and Preventive Services (Sec. 3201) This section expands the scope of available diagnostic testing for COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) that private health- insurance plans must cover. Specifically, it requires coverage of tests that have not been approved by the FDA if   the developer of such a test requests, or intends to request, emergency use authorization, unless such request is denied or is not submitted within a reasonable time; the test is developed and authorized in a state that has notified HHS that the state intends to review such tests; or HHS has issued guidance that such test is appropriate.  (Sec. 3202) This section specifies the process for private health-insurance plan issuers to reimburse providers of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Specifically, a reimbursement rate negotiated for such test prior to the public health emergency declared on January 31, 2020, continues to apply for the duration of the emergency. If a reimbursement rate was not negotiated prior to the emergency declaration, an issuer may either negotiate such rate or pay the provider's cash price. Additionally, test providers must publish the cash price of tests on their websites; HHS may assess a civil penalty for violations of this requirement. (Sec. 3203) This section shortens the time frame under which private health-insurance plans must cover certain new preventative services related to COVID-19. Under current law, health plans have one year to cover services recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force or the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Under this section, health plans must cover such services to prevent or diagnose COVID-19 within 15 days. Subpart B--Support for Health Care Providers (Sec. 3211) This section provides for additional funding to health centers that serve medically underserved populations for evidence-based models that increase access to high-quality primary-care services for purposes of (1) the detection of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19; or (2) the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of that disease.

(Sec. 3213) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise modifies grant programs for rural health services outreach, rural health network development, and small health care provider quality improvement. Among other changes, the bill expands eligibility for certain grants to include entities that are not nonprofits. (Sec. 3214) This section allows for the deployment of the Ready Reserve Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (Commissioned Corps) to serve in public health emergencies. Certain provisions related to compensation and leave without authority that apply to the Armed Forces shall also apply to officers of the Commissioned Corps or their beneficiaries. (Sec. 3215) This section extends liability protection for harm caused by acts or omissions by volunteer health care professionals in the course of providing certain health care services relating to COVID-19 during the public health emergency, in accordance with specified limitations. (Sec. 3216) This section authorizes the reassignment of members of the National Health Services Corps to provide health care services at alternative sites in response to the public health emergency, subject to the voluntary agreement of the corps members and other specified restrictions. Subpart C--Miscellaneous Provisions (Sec. 3221) This section more closely aligns the federal privacy standards applicable to substance-use disorder patient records with the relevant privacy and de-identification standards applicable to other records that contain personal health information for the purposes of (1) treatment, payment, and health care operations by health plans, providers, or clearinghouses; and (2) disclosures to public health authorities. The section requires patients to give affirmative, written consent; once given, that consent applies to future disclosures. Such consent may be revoked by written request.  The section also (1) aligns criminal penalties for certain violations involving substance-use disorder patient records with the penalties that apply to violations involving other types of records containing personal health information; (2) expands the current prohibition against using substance-use disorder patient records in criminal proceedings to include any use in specified federal, state, and local criminal and civil actions; and (3) prohibits certain discrimination based on the release of such patient records with respect to access to treatment, employment, housing, and certain social services and benefits (Sec. 3222) This section allows a state agency or area agency on aging to transfer funds between congregate and home-delivered nutrition services programs for older adults without prior approval to meet the needs of the state or area served during the public health emergency. The section also (1) expands eligibility for home-delivered meals to include those who are unable to obtain nutrition because they are practicing social distancing, and (2) permits the Administration on Aging to waive certain nutrition requirements for meals provided through the nutrition services for older adults during the emergency. (Sec. 3223) This section permits the Department of Labor, in response to the effects of the public health emergency, to increase the length of time individuals may participate in, and the amount available to pay authorized administrative costs for, Community Service Employment Program projects for older adults. (Sec. 3224) This section directs HHS to issue guidance within 180 days on the sharing of protected health information during specified emergency declarations with respect to COVID-19.  (Sec. 3225) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise makes changes to the Healthy Start for Infants initiative, which focuses on reducing infant mortality and improving perinatal outcomes. Among other changes, the bill requires HHS to consider additional factors, such as data collection and evaluation methods, when awarding grants. In addition, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) must conduct an independent evaluation of the program. (Sec. 3226) HHS must carry out a national public awareness campaign in consultation with relevant federal agencies and other stakeholders on blood donations and the need for donations for the blood supply during the public health emergency. PART III--INNOVATION (Sec. 3301) This section eliminates the requirement for a specified written determination for the use of other transaction authority (OTA) for projects expected to cost in excess of $100 million during certain public health emergencies. (OTA allows the Biomedical Research and Development Authority to enter into certain other transactions that are generally exempt from the federal procurement laws and regulations that apply to contracts, grants and cooperative agreements.) Such transactions shall not be terminated solely due to the expiration of such a public health emergency. (Sec. 3302) The FDA must expedite the review of a new animal drug if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug, alone or in combination, may prevent or treat a serious zoonotic disease (i.e., a disease that can be spread from animals to humans).  PART IV--HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE (Sec. 3401) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise makes changes to specified education and training programs concerning the health professions workforce, including (1) centers related to workforce analysis and health professions education, and (2) certain loan-repayment and other educational assistance programs for specified health professionals. (Sec. 3402) HHS must develop a plan with respect to health care workforce development programs in consultation with specified stakeholders. Among other topics, the plan must include performance measures and identify gaps between the outcomes of such workforce programs and certain workforce projection reports. (Sec. 3403) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise modifies education and training programs related to the geriatric workforce. Among other changes, the section (1) provides specific statutory authority for the Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program, which provides grants to health professions schools and other approved programs in order to improve health care for older adults and maximize patient and family engagement; and (2) revises application, reporting, and other requirements for the Geriatric Academic Career Awards, which promote career development for certain academic geriatricians or other geriatric health professionals in academic settings.  (Sec. 3404) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise modifies nursing workforce education and training programs. Among other changes, the section expands eligibility for certain grants to nurse-managed clinics and clinical nurse specialist programs. In addition, the GAO must evaluate nurse loan-repayment programs and report recommendations on how to improve such programs. Subtitle B--Education Provisions COVID-19 Pandemic Education Relief Act of 2020 (Sec. 3503) The Department of Education (ED) must waive the requirement, for award years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, that institutions of higher education (IHEs) provide matching funds under the Federal Work-Study and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant programs. During a qualifying emergency, IHEs may transfer their unexpended allotments from the Federal Work-Study program to their allotments for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program. (Sec. 3504) IHEs may reserve Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant funds to award emergency financial-aid grants to undergraduate or graduate students for unexpected expenses and unmet financial needs caused by a qualifying emergency. (Sec. 3505) IHEs may continue to make Federal Work-Study payments to affected work-study students for the period of time, not to exceed one academic year, in which the affected students were unable to work because of a qualifying emergency.

(Sec. 3507) This section excludes from a student's Pell Grant duration limit any semester or equivalent that the student does not complete because of a qualifying emergency. (Sec. 3508) If a student withdraws from an IHE due to a qualifying emergency, ED must   waive the IHE's obligation to return title IV funds with respect to the student, if the withdrawal was during the payment period or period of enrollment;  waive the student's obligation to return Pell Grants or other grant assistance; and  cancel the borrower's obligation to repay Federal Direct Loans, if the withdrawal was during the payment period.  An IHE may provide a student with an approved leave of absence that does not require the student to return at the same point in the academic program if the student returns within the same semester. (Sec. 3509) IHEs may exclude attempted credits that were not completed as a result of a qualifying emergency from the qualitative component of the satisfactory academic progress calculation without requiring an appeal by the student. (Sec. 3510) This section authorizes ED to permit foreign IHEs to offer distance education during an emergency.  ED may allow foreign IHEs, for financial-aid purposes, to enter into certain written arrangements with IHEs located in the United States.

(Sec. 3514) The Corporation for National and Community Service must allow an individual who is performing limited service due to COVID-19, or whose position was suspended or placed on hold due to COVID-19, to accrue other service hours that will count toward the number of hours needed for the individual's education award. (Sec. 3515) Local workforce boards may use a specified portion of certain federal funds for administrative costs related to carrying out local workforce investment activities in response to a qualifying emergency.

Subtitle C--Labor Provisions  (Sec. 3601) Current law specifies that paid family and medical leave with respect to the COVID-19 public health emergency shall not exceed $200 per day or $10,000 in the aggregate. This section instead specifies that an employer shall not be required to pay more than those amounts per employee.  (Sec. 3602) This section establishes limits on the daily and aggregate amounts of emergency paid sick leave that employers must pay to employees who are unable to work due to the effects of COVID-19.

Subtitle F--Over-The-Counter Drugs PART I--OTC DRUG REVIEW This subtitle makes significant changes to the regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of nonprescription (i.e., over-the-counter or OTC) drugs, which typically includes products found in the drugstore aisle, such as antacids, pain relievers, and cough and cold medicines. (Sec. 3851) This part establishes a new approval process for OTC medications. Specifically, it creates an FDA administrative order process for the evaluation of OTC products, replacing the present notice and comment rulemaking approach. Under the new process, the FDA may issue an administrative order determining a specific OTC drug, class of drugs, or combination is generally regarded as safe and effective and not subject to the new drug application process. The FDA may also use the administrative order process to (1) determine a drug, class of drugs, or combination pose an imminent hazard to the public health; or (2) require labeling changes to mitigate a significant or unreasonable risk of a serious adverse event associated with use of the drug. The bill provides for market exclusivity under certain circumstances. For drugs determined to be generally regarded as safe and effective pursuant to an administrative order requested by a sponsor (rather than initiated by the FDA), the requestor is granted 18 months of market exclusivity. This market exclusivity applies to an OTC drug with a new active ingredient or where the requestor conducted new human studies to get approval. The Government Accountability Office must review the impact of granting market exclusivity to such OTC sponsors, including the impact on innovation. (Sec. 3852) OTC drugs that do not comply with the requirements in this part are deemed misbranded (i.e., improperly labeled). (Sec. 3853) The new requirements do not apply to any OTC product that was marketed in the United States before May 11, 1972. (Sec. 3854) This section allows a sponsor of a nonprescription sunscreen active ingredient or a combination of such ingredients that was subject to a proposed sunscreen order to transition to the administrative order process.

(Sec. 3856) The section makes technical corrections related to the new OTC requirements. PART II--USER FEES (Sec. 3862) This part establishes a user fee program for OTC drugs under which the FDA must assess user fees on persons who own an OTC facility or who request an administrative order for an OTC drug.

Any guarantee must (1) be limited to the value of a shareholder's account in a money-market fund as of the close of business the day before the announcement of the guarantee, and (2) terminate no later than December 31, 2020.  The Exchange Stabilization Fund must be reimbursed, upon termination of this authority, to the extent that payments made exceed fees collected.  (Sec. 4016) Certain membership, credit-extension, and borrowing restrictions regarding the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility are temporarily waived.

For determining eligibility, the interests of two or more related individuals in an entity are aggregated.  Any entity seeking to receive loans, loan guarantees, and other investments as provided by this subtitle must certify to the Federal Reserve Board that it is not in violation of these conflict-of-interest restrictions. (Sec. 4020) This section establishes the Congressional Oversight Commission. The commission must conduct oversight of the implementation of this subtitle by Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board, including efforts by Treasury and the board to provide economic stability in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The commission must report to Congress monthly and must\u00a0generally review the implementation of this subtitle by the federal government.  The commission may hold hearings, take testimony, and receive evidence in the course of carrying out its duties. (Sec. 4021) If a furnisher of credit information provides an accommodation to a consumer affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, and the consumer complies with the terms of the accommodation, the creditor generally must report the account as current.   (Sec. 4022) Borrowers\u00a0who have federally backed mortgages and are experiencing financial hardship during the COVID-19 outbreak may request a forbearance on their mortgage payments.

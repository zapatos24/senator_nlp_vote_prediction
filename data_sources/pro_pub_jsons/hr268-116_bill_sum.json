The bill provides $14.2 billion in FY2019 supplemental appropriations for expenses related to the consequences of recent wildfires, hurricanes, volcanos, earthquakes, typhoons, and other natural disasters. The bill designates the spending as emergency spending, which is exempt from discretionary spending limits.  The bill includes supplemental appropriations for   the Department of Agriculture,   the Department of Commerce,   the Department of Justice,   the Department of Defense,   the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,   the Department of the Interior,   the Department of Energy,   the U.S. Coast Guard,   the Environmental Protection Agency,  the Forest Service,  the Department of Health and Human Services,  the Department of Labor,   the Department of Education,   the Government Accountability Office,   the Department of Veterans Affairs,   the Department of Transportation, and   the Department of Housing and Urban Development.   The bill also provides continuing FY2019 appropriations to several federal agencies through the earlier of February 8, 2019, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations legislation.  This is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and ends the partial government shutdown that began after the existing CR expired on December 21, 2018, because seven of the remaining FY2019 appropriations bills have not been enacted.  (Five of the FY2019 appropriations bills were enacted last year, including the   Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019;  the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019;  the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019;  the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2019; and  the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019.)  Additionally, the CR has the effect of extending through February 8, 2019, several authorities and programs that were extended in prior CRs, including   the Violence Against Women Act,  the authority for the Environmental Protection Agency to collect and spend certain fees related to pesticides,  the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, and  several authorities related to immigration.

Subdivision 2--Tax Relief and Medicaid Changes Relating To Certain Disasters  TITLE I--CALIFORNIA FIRES  This title amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow various tax credits, deductions, and modifications to existing rules for individuals and businesses affected by wildfires in California.  (Sec. 20101) A \"California wildfire disaster zone\" is the portion of the California wildfire disaster area determined by the President to warrant federal assistance under the Stafford Act by reason of wildfires in California.  A \"California wildfire disaster area\" is an area with respect to which between January 1, 2017, through January 18, 2018, a major disaster has been declared by the President under the Stafford Act by reason of wildfires in California.  (Sec. 20102) This section waives the 10% additional tax on early distributions from retirement plans for up to $100,000 in qualified wildfire distributions.  A \"qualified wildfire distribution\" must be made on or after October 8, 2017, and before January 1, 2019, to an individual: (1) whose principal place of abode during any portion of the period from October 8, 2017, to December 31, 2017, is located in the California wildfire disaster area, and (2) who has sustained an economic loss by reason of the wildfires to which the declaration of the area relates.  A taxpayer who has received such a distribution may: (1) repay the distribution by making additional contributions to a retirement account within three years, and (2) include the distribution in gross income by dividing the amount over a three-year period.  This section also: (1) permits individuals to recontribute funds to retirement plans if the funds were distributed for a home purchase in a California wildfire disaster area that was cancelled on account of the wildfires, and (2) increases the limit and extends the repayment deadline for loans from retirement plans.  (Sec. 20103) This section allow an employee retention tax credit for employers affected by the California wildfires. The credit is equal to 40% of the qualified wages (up to $6,000 per employee) paid to an employee whose principal place of employment on October 8, 2017, with the employer was in the California wildfire disaster zone.  \"Qualified wages\" include wages that: (1) are paid or incurred on or after October 8, 2017, and before January 1, 2018; and (2) occurred during the period that begins when the trade or business became inoperable at the principal place of employment of the employee immediately before the wildfires and ends when the trade or business has resumed significant operations.  (Sec. 20104) The section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to temporarily suspend the limitations on charitable contributions made during the period beginning on October 8, 2017, and ending on December 31, 2018, for relief efforts in the California wildfire disaster area.  The section also modifies the deduction for personal casualty losses in the California wildfire disaster areas to eliminate: (1) the requirement for losses to exceed 10% of adjusted gross income to qualify for the deduction, and (2) the requirement to itemize.  For the purposes of determining earned income for the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, certain taxpayers affected by the California wildfires may use earned income from the immediately preceding year.  TITLE II--TAX RELIEF FOR HURRICANES HARVEY, IRMA, AND MARIA  (Sec. 20201) This title amends the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 to modify the Hurricanes Harvey and Irma Disaster Areas to include areas with respect to which a major disaster has been declared by the President before October 17, 2017 (before September 21, 2017, under current law) under the Stafford Act by reasons of Hurricanes Harvey or Irma.  TITLE III--HURRICANE MARIA RELIEF FOR PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS MEDICAID PROGRAMS  (Sec. 20301) This title increases Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands through FY2019. Such funding shall be further increased through 2019 for each territory if the territory takes specified actions to improve its Medicaid program. The division also increases the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for the additional funds to 100%.  TITLE IV--BUDGETARY EFFECTS  (Sec. 20401) This section designates this subdivision as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Act of 2010. (This prohibits the budgetary effects of this subdivision from being counted for the purpose of PAYGO rules that prohibit certain revenue and direct spending legislation from increasing the deficit.)  (Sec. 20402) In the Senate, this subdivision is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to the FY2018 congressional budget resolution. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.)  Subdivision 3--Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018  Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018  (Sec. 20101) This subdivision amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to provide continuing FY2018 appropriations to federal agencies through March 23, 2018 (February 8, 2018, under current law).  It ends the government shutdown that began when the existing continuing resolution (CR) expired because the FY2018 appropriations bills have not been enacted.  The subdivision also:   continues funding authority to maintain the schedule and deliver the required data according to statutory deadlines in the 2020 Decennial Census Program,  makes additional funding available for the Southeastern Power Administration,  permits the Department of Energy to draw down and sell up to $350 million of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during FY2018 and requires the proceeds to be used for the SPR modernization program,  makes additional funding available to the judiciary for juror fees,  provides additional funding for the staffing of newly opened or expanded Indian Health Service facilities,  continues Department of Education authority to make account maintenance fee payments to guaranty agencies under the Federal Family Education Loan program,  modifies existing authority to allow the Department of Education to waive cohort default rate requirements for public institutions of higher education operating in economically distressed counties,  provides authority for new construction starts for projects associated with the DOD F-35A Joint Strike Fighter program,  makes technical corrections related to the authority of the Department of Transportation to consolidate its credit programs, and  extends HUD's HOPE VI program for the duration of the CR. (The program provides funds to renovate or demolish existing public housing and replace it with mixed-income housing.)  DIVISION C--BUDGETARY AND OTHER MATTERS  TITLE I--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT  (Sec. 30101) This title amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to increase the defense and nondefense discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019.  The title revises procedures for implementing the sequester of direct spending, which is required under current law and involves cuts that interact with discretionary spending levels. The title requires the sequester to take place in FY2018 and FY2019 as if the amendments that this title makes to the discretionary spending limits have not been made.  It also extends the sequester for mandatory spending through FY2027 (currently through FY2025) and adjusts the cuts required for Medicare.  (Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is spending provided by laws other than appropriations bills. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)  (Sec. 30102) This section resets the balances on the scorecards established by the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) to zero.  (Sec. 30103) After April 15, 2018, but not later than May 15, 2018, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee must file committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this bill. The chairman may also include the deficit neutral reserve funds contained in the FY2018 budget resolution updated by one fiscal year.  After April 15, 2018, the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the Senate as if they were included in a FY2019 congressional budget resolution.  This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2019.  (Sec. 30104) After April 15, 2018, but not later than May 15, 2018, the chairman of the House Budget Committee must submit for publication in the Congressional Record committee allocations, aggregate spending levels, and aggregate revenue levels consistent with this bill.  If a FY2019 congressional budget resolution has not been adopted by April 15, 2018, the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the House of Representatives as if they were included in a FY2019 congressional budget resolution.  The chairman may adjust the levels to reflect the budgetary effects of any legislation enacted during the 115th Congress that reduces the deficit or as otherwise necessary.  This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2019.  (Sec. 30105) This section specifies that section 30103 and section 30104 are enacted under the rulemaking powers of the Senate and the House of Representatives and will be considered part of the rules of each chamber. It also recognizes that each chamber has the authority to change the rules.  TITLE II--OFFSETS  (Sec. 30201) This section amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to extend the authority of Treasury to collect certain customs user fees.  It also amends the United States--Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act to extend the increased rate for merchandise processing fees.  (Sec. 30202) This section extends the requirement for DOT to deposit into the Treasury a portion of the aviation security service fees charged to passengers of air carriers.  (Sec. 30203) This section amends the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act to extend certain immigration fees for: (1) using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program, and (2) L-1 (intracompany transferees) and H-1B visas (temporary workers in professions specialty occupations).  (Sec. 30204) DOE must draw down and sell specified oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during FY2022-FY2025, FY2026, and FY2027 and deposit the proceeds in the Treasury during the fiscal year in which the sale occurs.  DOE may not draw down and sell crude oil under this section in quantities that would limit the authority to sell petroleum products under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act in order to prevent or reduce adverse impacts of severe domestic energy supply interruptions.  This section amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to: (1) modify the conditions for a drawdown for the SPR to require DOE to find that the action will not impair the ability of the U.S. to carry out U.S. obligations under the international energy program, and (2) prohibit a draw down when there are fewer than 450 million (currently 350 million) barrels of petroleum product stored in the SPR.  (Sec. 30205) This section amends the Federal Reserve Act to reduce the limit on the aggregate amount of the surplus funds of the Federal Reserve banks from $10 million to $7.5 million. Under current law, surplus funds that exceed or would exceed the limit must be deposited into the Treasury.  (Sec. 30206) The Department of Labor must award grants for states to conduct a program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments for certain individuals who receive unemployment compensation.  This section also amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require discretionary spending limits, committee allocations, and budget aggregates to be adjusted, subject to specified limits, for legislation that appropriates more than $117 million for a fiscal year for the grants.  TITLE III--TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT  (Sec. 30301) The public debt limit is suspended through March 1, 2019. On March 2, 2019, the limit is increased to accommodate obligations issued during the suspension period.  Adjustments to the debt limit for obligations during the suspension period are limited to obligations necessary to fund a commitment incurred by the federal government that required payment before March 2, 2019. The Department of the Treasury may not issue obligations during the suspension period to increase cash balances above normal operating balances.  TITLE IV--JOINT SELECT COMMITTEES  Subtitle A--Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans  (Sec. 30422) This subtitle establishes a joint select committee of Congress to provide recommendations and legislative language that will significantly improve the solvency of multiemployer pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.  The joint committee terminates on December 31, 2018, or 30 days after submission of its report and legislative recommendations, whichever occurs first. (Sec. 30423) The Senate may allocate up to $500,000 from the special reserve within the Expenses of Inquiries and Investigations account for use by the joint committee. None of the funds provided by this section may be obligated by the joint committee after January 2, 2019.  (Sec. 30424) The Senate must consider legislation proposed by the joint committee using specified expedited legislative procedures.  Subtitle B--Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform  (Sec. 30442) This subtitle establishes a joint select committee of Congress to provide recommendations and legislative language that will significantly reform the budget and appropriations process.  The joint committee terminates on December 31, 2018, or 30 days after submission of its report and legislative recommendations, whichever occurs first. (Sec. 30443) The Senate may allocate up to $500,000 from the special reserve within the Expenses of Inquiries and Investigations account for use by the joint committee.
